                Here are some Bible verses for you;
                He wants to "prosper you and not to harm you, to give hope and a future" (Jeremiah 29:11) 
                You can also send these to a family member or friend in need and be assured that God 
                can work miracles when we choose to believe His promises! Use these verses to be inspired 
                and motivated to 
                continue believing and having faith!

                    Isaiah 40:28-31  
                    28 Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, 
                    the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not
                     grow tired or weary, and his understanding no 
                     one can fathom. 29 He gives strength to the weary and 
                     increases the power of the weak. 30 Even youths grow
                      tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; 31 but those
                       who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. 
                       They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not 
                       grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.

         2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that ALL Scripture 
            is inspired by God and useful for teaching, rebuking, 
            correcting, and training in righteousness. The Bible is a work of 
            God that was written by human men that were inspired by God. 
            What better source of inspiration than our Creator! Whether you 
            are looking for motivation, encouragement, reassurance, or peace,
            the Bible
             should be the first resource you turn to! </p>

                    Romans 8:38-39
                    38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, 
                    neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor
                     the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor 
                     depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be 
                     able to separate us from the love of God that is 
                     in Christ Jesus our Lord.
